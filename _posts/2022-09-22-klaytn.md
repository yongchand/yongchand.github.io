# Klaytn ETL and BigQuery Introduction
## Klaytn ETL
--- 
Klaytn-ETL is the Python scripts for ETL (extract, transform and load) jobs for Klaytn blocks, transactions, ERC20 / ERC721 tokens, transfers, receipts, logs, contracts, and internal transactions. The script is based on Ethereum ETL, and you can check the repository in [Klaytn ETL](https://github.com/klaytn/klaytn-etl). Stars and contributions are welcomed!

## Klaytn ETL in Airflow
---
Klaytn runs `enrich_block_group` and `enrich_trace_group` CLIs in hourly batch using Airflow. The data will be exported in JSON.GZ format in GCS. From GCS, Klaytn create s external table in BigQuery.

## Klaytn BigQuery Dataset
---
Currently 8 tables are available, containing data from 2022-09-14 to now.
- data-test-361602.klaytn_data_test.cypress_blocks_table
- data-test-361602.klaytn_data_test.cypress_transactions_table
- data-test-361602.klaytn_data_test.cypress_traces_table
- data-test-361602.klaytn_data_test.cypress_tokens_table
- data-test-361602.klaytn_data_test.cypress_token_transfers_table
- data-test-361602.klaytn_data_test.cypress_contracts_table
- data-test-361602.klaytn_data_test.cypress_receipts_table
- data-test-361602.klaytn_data_test.cypress_logs_table

You can query like following 
```
### Daily Active Address Count
WITH TOTAL_ADDRESS AS (
SELECT 
  CAST(block_timestamp as DATE) as block_date,
  from_address as address
FROM
  data-test-361602.klaytn_data_test.cypress_transactions_table
WHERE 
  from_address IS NOT NULL
UNION ALL
select
    CAST(block_timestamp as DATE) as block_date,
    to_address as address
FROM
  data-test-361602.klaytn_data_test.cypress_transactions_table
WHERE 
  from_address IS NOT NULL)
SELECT 
  block_date, 
  COUNT(address) as active_address_count
FROM 
  TOTAL_ADDRESS
GROUP BY
  block_date
ORDER BY
  block_date
```
Since dataset is not optimized for now, query may take some time (~30s)

## TODO
- Support streaming
- Make query faster with optimization
- Add block date, block hour
